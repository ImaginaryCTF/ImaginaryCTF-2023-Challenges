## Description

And everywhere that Mary went,
The flag was sure to go.

## Distribution

## Solution

This challenge uses lambda calculus to convert the user input to a list of bits, do a little bit of math on it, and compare it to a hardcoded list.

Fun fact - this was *almost* RSA encoded in lambda calculus - I just ran out of time.
